            dignified, professional, and courteous service at all times. <b>First Class Travelers</b> accepts checked
            wheelchairs, provided they collapse to fit in the storage bin of the bus. If you have special needs, upon

        <p style="padding-top: 10px; color: #57769d;"><u>BAGGAGE:</u></p>

        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"><b><u>On Board:</u></b> Each passenger is allowed 2 free carry-on bag and one
            small, personal item. Carry-on bags must be small enough to fit under the seat or in our overhead bins. Bags
            stored in our overhead bins must be closeable so that their contents do not spill out during the trip.</p>

        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"><b><u>Underneath:</u></b> Each ticketed passenger is allowed 2 free suitcases or
            other large pieces of luggage with a maximum weight of 55 lbs. <b><u>Passengers do not load their own

        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">We realize that some of our passengers have sensitive musical instruments. Large
            instruments, such as cellos, can typically be placed by themselves underneath the luggage bay. If a
            passenger desires a space on board the bus for a special musical instrument, the passenger will likely have
            to purchase a separate seat.</p>

        <p style="padding-top: 10px;"><b><u>Bicycles:</u></b> Bicycles are permitted underneath our buses if space is
            available.</p>

            vehicles <b>are not permitted</b> on board our buses. Motorized wheelchairs and other devices needed for the
            mobility of persons with disabilities are permitted on our buses, and do not count against the large /
            over-weight luggage limit.</p>

        <p style="padding-top: 10px; color: #57769d;"><u>PROHIBITED ITEMS:</u></p>

            buses:</u></p>

        <ul style=" margin: 0; padding-left: 20px; padding-top: 10px; color: #FF0004; ">

            bags with name and contact information. <b>First Class Travelers LLC</b> disclaims any liability for
            particularly expensive, valuable, or fragile items such as, but not limited to, computers, electronics,
            jewelry, banknotes, artwork, collectibles, or antiques, and we strongly recommends that these items remain
