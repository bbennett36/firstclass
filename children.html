        <p style="padding-top: 30px; color: #57769d;"><u>Children Discount & Policy</u></p>

        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Children discounted tickets are available for children ages 2 - 9 years old.

            or at terminal agencies only. Discount tickets will not be available online.</p>


        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">Children discounted tickets can only be purchased together with an adult ticket.
            For every 1 adult ticket, only 2 children tickets can be purchased. If traveling with 3 or more children,
            two adult tickets would have to be purchased to obtain the child discount tickets. Only 2 children
            discounted tickets per 1 adult ticket. The child and adult must travel together on the same schedule, same
            time, and same day.</p>

        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">A child under 2 years of age does not require a ticket to travel but must be
            secured in the guardians lap for the duration of the trip (a child under the age of 2 cannot occupy a seat
            without being secured in a child safety seat). If a child safety seat will occupy a seat there will be a
            fare at childrenâ€™s discounted rate.</p>
