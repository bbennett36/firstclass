        </p></div>

        <p style="padding-top: 30px;">The creation of <b>First Class Travelers</b> started well over 47 years ago, when
            a little boy from Brooklyn, New York (with Southern values) would get into trouble with his parents for
            wanting to see the buses outside of the doors at the Port Authority bus terminal.----------------------</p>


        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">I found my passion at a very young age. Countless amount of times I traveled by
            bus during the summer months between New York City and South Carolina to visit relatives. Upon arriving I
            would always have an exciting story to tell my grandparents about the bus I was riding on and interacting
            with the driver.</p>

        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">As I got older I wanted to serve my country, so I joined the US. Army.
            Approximately 1 year before ending my Military career, I took on a part time job with a local bus company in
            Killeen, TX. After many years serving in the Army I decided to end my Military career with an Honorable
            Discharge so I could pursue my passion. I also left the local bus company to join a much larger bus carrier
            to gain more knowledge of the operations and functions of a bus company. I then became a Motor Coach
            Operator for one of the largest carriers during that time. As the years passed I wanted to learn more so I
            became a Diesel Mechanic. Having;</p>

        <ul style="padding-left: 50px; padding-bottom: 10px; padding-top: 20px;">
            <li>Being in the Military and as a well-disciplined soldier, a respected Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO),
                having an impeccable leadership skills
            </li>
            <li>Years of experience as a Motor Coach Driver</li>
            <li>Becoming a Driver Instructor (receiving all safety awards the company offered as a driver)</li>
            <li>Years of being a Diesel Mechanic</li>
            <li>Learning the administrative operations of a bus company inside and out</li>
            <li>My knowledge of how a bus company functions
                led me to fulfill my childhood dreams to become an owner of my own bus company.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">April 2014 I created <b>First Class Travelers LLC</b>.</p>

        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">I’ve been riding on buses for most of my childhood life, and if there’s anyone who
            can tell you the difference between a good or bad bus trip. I would be that one! That’s why I put my heart
            into the creation of <b>First Class Travelers LLC</b>. I want to ensure that “<u>ALL</u>” of my valued
            riders are treated with <u>respect</u>, <u>courtesy</u>, and as a <u>First Class Traveler!</u> That prompt
            me to name my Company <b>First Class Travelers</b>….
        <p>

        <p style="padding-top: 20px;">A very good childhood friend B.T.W once asked me, why do I love buses and being
            around them so much, I replied to him; “I like seeing passengers smiling faces when they’ve reached their
            destination, and thanking the driver for a wonderful safe trip. I enjoy seeing passenger’s baggage arrived
            with them and not being lost, delayed or damaged. The joy of seeing the faces of people meeting their love
            ones when they get off the bus. That’s the joy I get”. As a child I knew buses was going to be my life. All
            the things I experienced in my childhood and much more!</p>
