Working on a website for a friend of mine. Most of the front end work was done on the site by another developer he had. 
I am working on making the book a trip page and scheduling page at the moment while also taking care of the backend with using Spring MVC and MySQL. Then I will start updating the front-end and make the site look more modern and professional.
